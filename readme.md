## User Stories

JumpBoxVR is a ping pong drinking game that tests player’s sense of space and the force control. During the game, the ping pong ball will go to the direction where the player looks at, and the flying distance is determined by the force measured with the wristband. The goal: the player needs to throw the ping pong ball that bounces at the numbered boxes and finally stays in the target box. The player should finish all levels as soon as possible.
